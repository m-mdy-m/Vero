# Vero

Vero is a text-based social platform idea — CLI-first, dev-friendly, and designed for sharing thoughts, theories, and structured discussions.  

Right now it’s just an idea and an early draft. The goal is to build a minimal engine where anyone can create their own client and interact in a transparent, text-first network.  

## Status
Work in progress. Nothing is implemented yet. Just brainstorming and early concepts.
