# Vero — Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open, inclusive, and productive community, we — the maintainers and contributors of Vero — commit to creating a respectful and supportive environment for everybody. We recognize that a healthy project requires clear expectations, mutual respect, and swift remediation of harmful behavior. This Code of Conduct outlines our standards and how we handle reports of unacceptable behavior.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces where Vero community interaction occurs, including but not limited to:

- The Vero repository and its issue and pull request trackers on GitHub (user: `m-mdy-m`),
- Project communication channels (mailing lists, chat, forums),
- Public or private events organized by project maintainers,
- Any other official or unofficial venues where contributors and users engage under the Vero banner.

## Expected Behavior

We expect participants to demonstrate:

- Respectful communication: treat others with courtesy, even in disagreement.
- Professionalism and helpfulness in code reviews, issues, and discussions.
- Good-faith collaboration and constructive feedback focused on problems, not people.
- Transparency when reporting issues or proposing changes (clear descriptions, steps to reproduce, relevant logs).
- Respect for privacy and the right of others to control their personal information.

## Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behaviors include, but are not limited to:

- Harassment, threats, or intimidation in any form.
- Hate speech, discriminatory remarks, or derogatory comments about race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, nationality, disability, or other protected characteristics.
- Doxxing, sharing private information without consent, or attempting to coerce private details.
- Targeted or sustained abuse toward an individual or a group.
- Obstruction of others’ contributions (e.g., intentionally blocking PRs, abusive review tactics).
- Spam, unrelated promotions, or deliberate attempts to derail conversations.
- Repeated, unjustified complaints or misuse of reporting mechanisms.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please report it. Reports should be sent to the project contact:

- **Email:** bitsgenix@gmail.com  
- **GitHub maintainer:** `m-mdy-m`

A report should include as much relevant information as possible: what happened, when, where (issue/PR link, chat, etc.), people involved, and any supporting evidence (logs, screenshots, message IDs). Reports will be handled with discretion and confidentiality to the extent possible.

## Enforcement

Upon receipt of a report, maintainers will:

1. Acknowledge receipt of the report and confirm the next steps with the reporter.
2. Evaluate the report promptly and fairly, seeking additional information if needed.
3. Take corrective action when necessary. Possible actions include:
   - Private warnings to contributors,
   - Temporary restrictions (e.g., temporary suspension of commenting or PR privileges),
   - Revocation of commit/merge rights,
   - Moderation or removal of content,
   - Permanent bans from the project or its channels in severe cases.

Maintainers will document enforcement actions for internal records and to ensure consistency. Where appropriate, the reporter will be informed of the outcome in a manner that respects privacy and legal considerations.

## Appeals and Dispute Resolution

If you are subject to an enforcement action and wish to appeal, please reply to the enforcement contact (bitsgenix@gmail.com) with additional context. Appeals should include any new evidence or clarifications. The maintainers will review appeals impartially; in complex cases, an independent panel of trusted community members may be convened.

## Confidentiality & Safety

- The project will respect the privacy of reporters and accused parties. Information about reports will only be shared on a need-to-know basis.
- If a matter involves imminent physical danger or illegal activity, reporters may be advised to contact local law enforcement. Project maintainers will cooperate with law enforcement only as legally required and will inform involved parties where appropriate.

## A Note on Moderation

Maintainers of Vero reserve the right to moderate content and behavior to preserve an environment consistent with this Code of Conduct. This may include removal of posts, locking threads, or temporary or permanent banning of accounts. Moderation aims to be fair, transparent, and consistent with the values expressed here.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is crafted for the Vero project to reflect modern, inclusive community standards. If you have suggestions for improving this document, please open an issue or contact the maintainers at bitsgenix@gmail.com.
